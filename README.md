# IRON HACK Data Project 2 README file
## from José Miguel González 

This is my second project as a former Data Science Actuary (I am already an Actuary so I am still working hard on the first part :baby:).

---

## **What does this project do?**
Well, this project put in practice what we have learned during this second module:

- In the first part, there is a Jupyter Notebook that contain some Exploratory Data Visualization Charts and Summary Statistics.
- The second component is a Tableau Dashboard with most relevant charts.
